# PHP 5.4 - File Upload Progress Bar

This is an example how to create a progress bar using PHP 5.4 to calculate the progress of a file being downloaded.

I also used the jQuery framework to query AJAX to know the percentage of the progress in real time.

Finally, if you want more info concerning this PHP feature, you can visit the official [PHP website](http://php.net/manual/en/session.upload-progress.php) or check my French ebook [here](http://01script.com/static/gifts/books/Barre-de-Progression-avec-PHP5.4.pdf).
